# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for decoupling the CourtFlow frontend from the backend, transforming the current Next.js full-stack application into separate frontend and backend services. This architectural change will improve scalability, enable independent deployment cycles, facilitate team specialization, and provide better separation of concerns.

The migration will transform the current monolithic Next.js application into a React-based frontend application and a standalone Node.js/Express backend API, while maintaining all existing functionality and data integrity.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Backend API Service Creation

**User Story:** As a system architect, I want to extract the backend logic into a standalone API service, so that the frontend and backend can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently with support for multiple frontend frameworks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the backend service is created THEN it SHALL provide a RESTful API that exposes all current functionality
2. WHEN the backend service starts THEN it SHALL connect to the existing PostgreSQL database using Prisma ORM
3. WHEN API endpoints are called THEN the backend SHALL return consistent JSON responses with proper HTTP status codes
4. WHEN authentication is required THEN the backend SHALL implement JWT-based authentication
5. WHEN database operations are performed THEN the backend SHALL maintain all existing data validation and business logic
6. WHEN background jobs are processed THEN the backend SHALL continue using BullMQ with Redis for job queue management
7. WHEN different frontend frameworks make requests THEN the backend SHALL support CORS configuration for multiple origins
8. WHEN API responses are formatted THEN they SHALL be framework-agnostic and consumable by React, Vue, Angular, or any HTTP client

### Requirement 2: Frontend Application Transformation

**User Story:** As a frontend developer, I want the frontend to be a standalone application that can be built with any modern framework, so that I can choose the best technology for my team and requirements.

5. WHEN caching is used THEN the backend SHALL implement Redis caching for performance optimization

### Requirement 7: Development and Deployment Workflow
