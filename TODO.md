Recommendations for Continued Maintainability
Maintain Documentation: Keep technical documentation current with implementation changes
Automate Testing: Continue expanding test coverage for new features
Monitor Performance: Regularly review performance metrics to identify bottlenecks
Update Dependencies: Regular dependency updates to address security vulnerabilities
Code Reviews: Implement code review processes for all changes
Version Control: Use semantic versioning and clear commit messages
Backup Strategies: Ensure regular backups of critical data


Implement Redis Clustering: Fully utilize the planned Redis clustering implementation for better cache/queue scalability.
Database Read Replicas: Consider implementing read replicas for the PostgreSQL database to distribute read load.
CDN for Static Assets: Use a CDN for static assets to reduce load on application servers.
Auto-scaling Configuration: Set up auto-scaling policies based on CPU/memory usage metrics.
Database Partitioning: Implement table partitioning for large tables like case_activities as data grows.
Caching Strategy Enhancement: Implement more aggressive caching for frequently accessed reference data.
Load Testing: Conduct regular load testing to identify bottlenecks under various load conditions.
